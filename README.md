## Welcome 

 The "Cars and Coffee" HTML page is thoughtfully designed to be both user-friendly and engaging, ensuring a delightful experience for every visitor. As soon as users land on the page, they are welcomed by a large, captivating image that perfectly captures the essence of cars and coffee events, setting an exciting tone for their visit. Accompanying this image is a short, friendly welcome message that introduces the site, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere right from the start.

The website is neatly divided into distinct sections, each dedicated to different aspects of the Cars and Event experience. Visitors can explore featured cars, delve into favorite coffee blends, and discover upcoming events. Each section is clearly titled, making it straightforward for users to find the information that interests them the most.

Enhancing the user experience further is a conveniently placed menu at the top of the page. This menu remains accessible as users scroll, allowing them to effortlessly navigate to various sections of the site at any point in their journey. This thoughtful design element ensures that users can smoothly and quickly transition between different parts of the page, enhancing their overall experience and engagement with the content.

## Header

- The navigation bar maintains a consistent design and placement across all pages, facilitating user navigation. It features a distinctive logo, links to the Home page, Menu for coffee and Member sections

- The logo and design are neat in a black and white scheme, with an (fa-car) icon on smaller devices instead of text

- When viewed on smaller devices, the 'fa-car' icon will appear and is easy to click on

## Design

- I chose the red, white, and black color scheme to make it unique and pop, yet also subtle. White is the main color, with black for text and borders, and red for all the panels and hovers.
- A favicon is used for a neat design and added fun. I chose a small car to match the theme.

## Bugs and known issues

- I had a lot of problems initially with scaling my images, but the issue was that I hadn't set my images as the background. This has now been fixed, and the images scale better on various screens. My mentor, Brian, helped me resolve this and explained it very well.
