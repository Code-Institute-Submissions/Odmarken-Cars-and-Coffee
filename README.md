## Welcome 

 The "Cars and Coffee" HTML page is thoughtfully designed to be both user-friendly and engaging, ensuring a delightful experience for every visitor. As soon as users land on the page, they are welcomed by a large, captivating image that perfectly captures the essence of cars and coffee events, setting an exciting tone for their visit. Accompanying this image is a short, friendly welcome message that introduces the site, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere right from the start.

The website is neatly divided into distinct sections, each dedicated to different aspects of the Cars and Coffee experience. Visitors can explore featured cars, delve into favorite coffee blends, and discover upcoming events. Each section is clearly titled, making it straightforward for users to find the information that interests them the most.

Enhancing the user experience further is a conveniently placed menu at the top of the page. This menu remains accessible as users scroll, allowing them to effortlessly navigate to various sections of the site at any point in their journey. This thoughtful design element ensures that users can smoothly and quickly transition between different parts of the page, enhancing their overall experience and engagement with the content. Through these user-centric design features, the "Cars and Coffee" page offers a welcoming and intuitive environment that encourages exploration and enjoyment for all who visit.

## Header

- The navigation bar maintains a consistent design and placement across all pages, facilitating user navigation. It features a distinctive logo, links to the Home page, Menu for coffee and Member sections

- The logo and design are neat in a black and white scheme, with an (fa-car) icon on smaller devices instead of text

- When viewed on smaller devices, the 'fa-car' icon will appear and is easy to click on


## Navigation

- Everything is centered in the middle for easy navigation throughout the entire website

- When viewed on smaller devices or tablets, a car icon will appear for a sleeker look, also matching the 'cars and coffee' theme.

- The different pages are Home, Menu, and Member, which are simple and easy to navigate through, making it easier to understand and view.

## Design

- I chose the red, white, and black color scheme to make it unique and pop, yet also subtle. White is the main color, with black for text and borders, and red for all the panels and hovers.
- A favicon is used for a neat design and added fun. I chose a small car to match the theme.
